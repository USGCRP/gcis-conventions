# The GCIS Resource Conventions


To better provide authoritative, accessible, usable, and timely information, GCIS resources need to be traceable and transparent to align with federal standards and practices. There are several resource types in the GCIS, each with an associated field convention, provenance convention, relationship convention, and research method. These conventions could be “default”, or “resource-specific”.
