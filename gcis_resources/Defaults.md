# Default Conventions

## Identifier Conventions

### Introduction  
To better provide authoritative, accessible, usable, and timely information, GCIS resources need to be traceable and transparent (ref: IQA).
Assigning citable, unique and persistent identifiers to information held within the GCIS greatly increases the transparency and traceability of that
information as well as addressing a growing trend within the Federal research community: requiring researchers to formally cite the data and
document the processes that led to a given research result (Mayernik, et al., 2012).

### Title

The Resources title (or name, if no title field) is modified to be come the
identifier. Spaces are replaced with `-`, and the words `"in," "and," "&",
"on," "the," and "of"` are removed (English only). All letters are lowercased.

### UUID

A [UUID](../external_conventions/UUID.md) is generated for the resource and used as the identifier. Globally
unique.

### Number

The Resource type has an incrementing number as the identifier. Unique only for
a given resource.
