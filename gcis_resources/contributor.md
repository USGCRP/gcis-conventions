# Contributor Conventions

## Appropriate Use Case

Contributors are created on all publications that provide publishers, authors, editors, etc unless the decision is made to not specify them.

## Field Conventions

**id**                      

An opaque numeric identifier for this contributor.

**person_id**

The person (optional).

**organization_identifier**

The organization.

**role_type_identifier**

Generally speaking these should match the exact role type specified in the publication. Where reasonable, synonymous types may be used (Chief Editor / Lead Editor). If the publication gives the role in a foreign language, we would use the existing matching translation or create a new English role to match.

**Point of Contact**  
We want to have a PoC on all publications where it is available, going forward. We are undecided on whether we will back-fill this in. May simply be the author. If an email ID is only provided for one person, they are PoC. If there is only one with a mail symbol but all have email IDs, the person with the symbol is the PoC. 

For third party reports we are loading into GCIS, we ask the third party who the PoC is.

**Author**  
This is the default role type assumed if no role is listed on the publication.

## Provenance Conventions

None

## Relationship Conventions

**Publication**

Contributors are created on all publications that provide publishers, authors, editors, etc unless the decision is made to not specify them.

**Reference**

Deprecated.  
We will not connect References to Contributors going forward, nor attempt to backfill in the connection.
