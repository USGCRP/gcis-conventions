# GCIS Model Run Conventions

## Appropriate Use Case

- We do not actively create or curate model runs.

- We will leave these objects alone for the time being, neither focusing on filling them in nor deprecating them.

- When automated data allows, filling in connections to datasets would be nice.

**Reasoning**

- It is nice to be able to say from the perspective of the models & projects to be able to say what science has come out of them. However we do not think that is really our focus. 

- We see no reason to take these away. Any time we could ingest the connections that would be nice. But we don't want to focus on manually collecting this information.

- Should we ask the authors for this? Probably not. The authors already fill in a lot of high priority data that we can't get from elsewhere.
