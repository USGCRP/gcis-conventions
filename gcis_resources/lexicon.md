# Lexicon Conventions

## Use Case

The Lexicon model establishes a useful way of linking the GCIS to external databases, such as the [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org/), the [CEOS database](http://database.eohandbook.com/), and [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/). This way, relevant information aggregated in an external database could be efficiently catalogued in the GCIS with useful tags (contexts).


## Field Conventions

| Field | Description |
|-------|------------- | 
|**title** | The name of the lexicon (external database)|
|**identifier** | A brief descriptive identifier for the lexicon|
|**description** | A description of the lexicon, possibly including the organization associated with it.|
|**description attribution** | The URL which contains the description of this lexicon given in the description field.|
|**url** | A url to the home page of an external database. |

## Provenance Conventions:

- None

## Relationship Conventions:
**Contexts:**
- Tags or keywords to delineate the type of aggregated information associated with each lexicon.
