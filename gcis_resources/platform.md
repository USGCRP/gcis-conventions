# Platform Conventions

## Appropriate Use Case

We do not actively create or curate platforms.

We will leave these objects alone for the time being, neither focusing on filling them in nor deprecating them.

When automated data allows, filling in connections to datasets would be nice.

**Reasoning**

Instruments & Platforms came out of ingesting all of CEOS into GCIS.

It is nice to be able to say from the perspective of the satellites and instruments to be able to say what science has come out of them. However we do not think that is really our focus. 

We see no reason to take these away. Any time we could ingest the connections that would be nice. But we don't want to focus on manually collecting this information.

Should we ask the authors for this? Probably not. The authors already fill in a lot of high priority data that we can't get from elsewhere.
