## In GCIS

A digital object identifier, or DOI, is a unique name assigned to permanently identify an object. A DOI name is used to digitally identify that object over the Internet in a standardized and interoperable manner. While DOI objects can be physical, digital or abstract entities, GCIS plans to assign these persistent identifiers to reports and other specific digital assets produced and published by USGCRP. The associated metadata and the underlying Digital Object Identifier (DOIÂ®) system allow users to transparently locate and track the tagged USGCRP assets.
