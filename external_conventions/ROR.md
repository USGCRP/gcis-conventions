# Research Organization Registry

## Definition
ROR is a community-led project to develop an open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifier for every research organization in the world.

The scope of ROR is the “affiliation use case” -  proper description of relationships between contributors, contributions, research sponsors, publishers, and employers. We use “affiliation” to describe any formal relationship between a researcher and an organization associated with researchers, including but not limited to their employer, educator, funder, or scholarly society. We define “research organization” as any organization that conducts, produces, manages, or touches research.

## GCIS Usage
Provides unique and usable identifiers for GCIS Organizations. Organizations are now mapped to external [ROR](https://ror.org/) identifiers through the [Lexicon](https://github.com/USGCRP/gcis-conventions/blob/v2.0.0/gcis_resources/lexicon.md) data model.
