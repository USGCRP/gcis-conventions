# Article Conventions

## Identifier Convention

An article'd [DOI](../external_conventions/doi.md) is used as the identifier
when it is available.  
If the article doesn't have a DOI, we use the title, with hyphens between words, lowercase letters, no numbers.

**Examples:**
   * for an article having the doi of [10.1002/aqc.880](http://data.globalchange.gov/article/10.1002/aqc.880)
      * http://data.globalchange.gov/article/10.1002/aqc.880
   *  since this article doesn't have a doi, we use the title.
      * http://data.globalchange.gov/article/resilience-adaptability-and-transformability-in-socialecological-systems
      * **Note:** this will be common practice for articles in law journals, which don't tend to have DOIs
