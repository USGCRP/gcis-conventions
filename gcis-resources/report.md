# Report Conventions

## Identifier Convention

Distributor abbreviation-title (separated out by hyphens)-version if available-years. We aren't consistent with this approach though. If the report has an internal identifier, we use that in-lieu of years. Some examples are as follows:

    - This is a National Research Council Report which has the internal identifier "Special Report 299."
      - `http://data.globalchange.gov/report/nrc-specialreport-299` 
    - This is a US Forest Service Report which has the internal identifier PNW-GTR-855 (for "Pacific Northwest Research Station General Technical Report 255)
      - `http://data.globalchange.gov/report/usfs-pnw-gtr-855` 
    - For the report distributed by the IPCC with the internal identifier "SREX."
      - `http://data.globalchange.gov/report/ipcc-srex` 
    - This is an ACWI report called "A National Framework for Ground-Water Modeling in the U.S." which was published in 2013.
      - `http://data.globalchange.gov/report/acwi-nationalframework-2013` 
    - is an exception to this role, as is http://data.globalchange.gov/report/2014car because these are well-known documents, each having a colloquial identifier.
      - `http://data.globalchange.gov/report/nca3`
