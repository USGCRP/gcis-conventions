# The Global Change Information System: an overview of its Data Model and Metadata Conventions

## Introduction

With over 15,000 people, 9,000 organizations, over 3,000 datasets, and much more, the [Global Change Information System](https://data.globalchange.gov/), or GCIS, catalogs a copious amount of information and metadata. Metadata in the system include the names of USGCRP report authors and their affiliations, report figures and images, datasets, and a substantial list of publications referenced in USGCRP Reports. These are either relationally or semantically linked with one another to improve the traceability of climate information and data provenance, thereby bolstering the overall utility of the GCIS. As the prime access point to U.S federal assessments on Climate Change, reports, and tools produced by the USGCRP – including the native data underpinning these resources – the GCIS is an important  resource for Global Change research.  

Given this brief description of the GCIS, it is imperative that the system make use of existing and highly regarded metadata standards and conventions where possible. This document  aims to describe the current GCIS data model, as well as highlight all the conventions and standards deployed in the system.
